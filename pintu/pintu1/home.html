      <i>Navaratri[a] is a biannual and one of the most revered Hindu festivals observed in the honour of Mother Goddess Durga. It spans over nine nights (and ten days), first in the month of Chaitra (March/April of the Gregorian calendar) and again in the month of Sharada. It is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Hindu Indian cultural sphere.[2][3] Theoretically, there are four seasonal Navaratri. However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn festival called Sharada Navaratri. The festival is celebrated in the bright half of the Hindu calendar month Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October.</i>

    <h1><mark>Chhath festivals</mark></h1>
    <i>Chhath is a major Hindu festival celebrated in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh.

      Almost all civilizations have worshipped the 'God Sun', but it has a unique form in Bihar Chhath Puja is the only occasion where the setting sun is worshipped along with the rising sun.
    
      According to the Hindu calendar, Chhath Puja is celebrated on the sixth day of Kartik month. Chhath Puja, also known as Surya Shashti, is a bathing festival followed by a four-day period of abstinence and ritual purity.
      
      Chhath Puja is a four-day long strict and spiritual observance. The first day of the Chhath Puja includes taking a dip in the holy river/any water body. People also take the water of Ganges to their homes to perform special offerings and rituals. Houses are thoroughly cleaned on this day. The second day of Chhath, also known as Kharna, involves devotees observing a day long fast, which is broken in the late evening after performing the worship of Mother Earth. The offerings to the God include rice pudding (kheer) and fruits, which is distributed among family members and friends. The third day of Chhath goes in the preparation of the prasad (offerings) for the evening offerings, also known as Sanjhiya Arghya.
    
      In the evening, large numbers of devotees gather on the banks of rivers and make offerings (Arghya) to the setting sun. The folk songs are played displaying the culture and history of Bihar. The night of the third day witnesses a colorful event known as Kosi. A canopy is made from sugarcane sticks and lighted earthen lamps are placed inside the canopy along with baskets filled with prasad. On the fourth and final day of Chhath, family members and friends go to the banks of rivers before sunrise and making offerings (Arghya) to the rising sun. After this ritual, devotees break their fast and distribute Prasad to neighbors and relatives.

    <h1><mark>Maha Shivaratri 2025</mark></h1>
    <i>Maha Shivaratri is predominantly a Hindu festival that happens every year in honour of Lord Shiva. The day marks the marriage day of Shiva. The day falls right at the end of the winter (late February or beginning of March) or just before the arrival of summer. A major festival for the Hindus, prayers are offered to overcome darkness and ignorance in one's life. In 2025, the auspicious occasion will be celebrated on the 26th of February, Wednesday. 
    <br>
    Maha Shivaratri is a revered Hindu festival that holds deep spiritual significance, signifying the triumph over darkness and life's obstacles through fasting and meditation. This auspicious occasion marks the convergence of the divine energies of Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti. It is believed that on this day, the spiritual energies of the Universe are particularly potent. The observance of Maha Shivaratri entails fasting, meditation on Lord Shiva, introspection, promoting social harmony, and vigils at Shiva temples. Unlike most Hindu festivals celebrated during daylight hours, Shivaratri is a unique festival observed during the night. 

There are several legends associated with Maha Shivaratri, and its significance is elaborated upon in various Puranas, including the Linga Purana. These texts emphasise the importance of observing Maha Shivaratri Vrat (fast) and paying homage to Lord Shiva and his symbolic representation, the Lingam. According to one legend, it was on this night that Lord Shiva performed the 'Tandava' dance, a powerful and divine expression of creation and destruction.  

Devotees chant Shiva hymns and recite scriptures, symbolically participating in the cosmic dance performed by the almighty and celebrating his omnipresence. Another legend relates to the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, which is said to have taken place on this day. This aspect makes the festival especially significant for married couples and unmarried women seeking a good husband
